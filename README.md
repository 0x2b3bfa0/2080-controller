# 2080-controller
Controller for Velleman MML24XX LED message boards and MMLXXX/RC IR remotes.<sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup><sub>Velleman MML24R is probably manufactured by Amplus ([AM03128-H11](http://www.amplus.com.hk/LED_%20AM03128-H13.htm)).</sub>

# Usage
The usage is almost the same as the Arduino-IRremote library (as my code is based on that library). I'll try to document the API in the future, but this is not going to happen anytime soon. Now you can simply read my <s>well structured</s> code and figure out the documentation. To find what I've modified from the original library, you can see [this commit](https://github.com/0x2b3bfa0/2080-controller/commit/6ade2232c3832eba8bb211379027a647f3132cfd).

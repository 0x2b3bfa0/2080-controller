# 2080-controller
Controller for Velleman MML24XX LED message boards and MMLXXX/RC IR remotes. The Velleman MML24R is probabily manufactured by Amplus ([AM03128-H11](http://www.amplus.com.hk/LED_%20AM03128-H13.htm))

# Usage
The usage is almost the same as the Arduino-IRremote library (as my code is based on that library). Maybe I document later what I've done. Now you can simply read my <s>well structured</s> code. To find what I've modified from the original library, you can see [this commit](https://github.com/crushedice2000/2080-controller/commit/6ade2232c3832eba8bb211379027a647f3132cfd)
